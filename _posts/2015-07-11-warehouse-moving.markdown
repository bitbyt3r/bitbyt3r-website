MAGFest has outgrown its warehouse. Years of rapid growth in 
popularity and attendance have been accompanied by significant growth 
in volume of junk to store. Eventually, the warehouse became so full 
that even with two levels to store things in, we completely ran out of 
space. Not to mention that the warehouse ceased to function as a 
work-space long ago, and that we never managed to get people to keep 
things inventoried and sorted, it was time for a bit change.

The new warehouse is three times as large, and more importantly allows 
us to keep all things on one level. No more carrying heavy things down 
a narrow staircase and using a liftgate to get them onto our truck. 
Our new warehouse is conveniently at dock-height, allowing us to do a 
dock-to-dock load-in. Did you hear that sound? That was the sound of 
every vertebrae of a MAGFest staff member rejoicing.

Another nice feature is the addition of workspace. When we build out 
laptops and servers for MAGClassic, we won't need to lug all bajillion 
crates of gear to a datacenter conference room and back. Now we can 
store, maintain, and stage all of our gear under one roof. For those 
of us in Techops, this should make a huge difference in the amount of 
coordination and time needed to prepare for each event. Two years ago, 
one of my brothers and I repaired and deployed all of the MAGFest 
laptops in our parents' kitchen. Not many laptops fit on our kitchen 
table at once, which is a problem when you have over one hundred 
laptops to image. The addition of open floor space to the warehouse 
affords us the opportunity to implement advanced tabular technology 
which will massively parallelize the build process.

A new space is not without issues, however. Aside from the monetary 
costs, there is a not-inconsiderable amount of staff effort involved 
in moving the warehouse, re-installing the pallet racking, 
renegotiating contracts, plumbing, electrical work, maintenance, etc. 
Moving to the new warehouse means developing a new organization 
system, which is to say, developing an organization system. We have 
been looking at warehouse management software for a while now, but 
even with something brilliant and well-integrated into 
[Ãœber](https://github.com/magfest/ubersystem) we will 
need to convince everyone to keep things up-to-date and to accept the 
delays caused by record keeping.

Overall, I am excited about the new space, and cannot wait to begin 
working in it.
