My name is Mark Murnane. I usually go by Bitbyt3r. I am a Computer Engineering major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I have worked 
several places as a Linux system administrator, and would be happy to talk your ears off about it. More recently, I am interning at Direct Dimensions 
Inc, an engineering firm specializing in three dimensional data acquisition and processing. I also do a fair amount of work running Linux systems for 
MAGFest.
